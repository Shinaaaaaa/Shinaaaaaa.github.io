## Welcome to My Academic Homepage
Hello, and thank you for visiting my academic homepage! My name is Dr. Alex Johnson, and I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Tech University. My research focuses on machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on developing interpretable deep learning models for applications in healthcare and sustainable systems.

## Research Interests
My work is dedicated to advancing the understanding and application of intelligent systems in real-world scenarios. My primary research interests include:

- Interpretable AI: Designing algorithms that provide transparency and accountability in decision-making systems.
- Healthcare Applications: Developing predictive models to assist in early diagnosis and treatment recommendations.
- Energy Optimization: Utilizing AI techniques to improve the efficiency of renewable energy systems and reduce carbon footprints.

I combine theoretical foundations with practical applications, leveraging tools like deep learning, Bayesian inference, and optimization. My research has been featured in top-tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, and AAAI, as well as journals like Nature Machine Intelligence.

## Selected Publications
Here are a few highlights of my recent publications:
